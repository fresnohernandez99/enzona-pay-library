## Including in your project

#### Gradle

```gradle
allprojects  {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```
Add the dependency.
```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.jdsdhp:enzonapay:$version'
}
```
## Usage

### Kotlin
After successfully creating the payment, a `PayCreateResponse` is received and the payment needs to be confirmed. For this, `PayWebViewFragment` is used passing as a parameter the response of the payment created.. This fragment  is usually added through a transition.

```kotlin
supportFragmentManager.beginTransaction()
    .setTransition(FragmentTransaction.TRANSIT_FRAGMENT_FADE) //Optional
    .replace(R.id.container, PayWebViewFragment.newInstance(payCreateResponse))
    .commit()
```

Use `WebViewLoadListener` to listen for status changes and errors that may arise.
```kotlin
supportFragmentManager.addFragmentOnAttachListener { _, fragment ->
    if (fragment is PayWebViewFragment) {
        fragment.webViewLoadListener = object : WebViewLoadListener {
            override fun onLoading(createResponse: PayCreateResponse) {
                //Write you logic here.
            }

            override fun onLoadFinish(createResponse: PayCreateResponse) {
                //Write you logic here.
            }

            override fun onError(
                createResponse: PayCreateResponse,
                code: Int?,
                message: String?,
            ) {
                //Write you logic here.
            }

            override fun onPaymentCanceled(createResponse: PayCreateResponse) {
                //Write you logic here.
            }

            override fun onPaymentConfirmed(createResponse: PayCreateResponse) {
                //Write you logic here.
            }
        }
    }
}
```
