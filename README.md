## Screenshots
Sample library project to test the payment platform.

The first step is **create the payment**.

A WebView should be use to **confirm the payment** through ENZONA web interface.

## Including in your project

#### Gradle

```gradle
allprojects  {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```
Add the dependency.
```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.jdsdhp:enzona-pay-library:$version'
}
```
## Usage

### Kotlin
After successfully creating the payment, a `PayCreateResponse` is received and the payment needs to be confirmed. For this, `PayWebViewFragment` is used passing as a parameter the response of the payment created.. This fragment  is usually added through a transition.

```kotlin
supportFragmentManager.beginTransaction()
    .setTransition(FragmentTransaction.TRANSIT_FRAGMENT_FADE) //Optional
    .replace(R.id.container, PayWebViewFragment.newInstance(payCreateResponse))
    .commit()
```

Use `WebViewLoadListener` to listen for status changes and errors that may arise.
```kotlin
supportFragmentManager.addFragmentOnAttachListener { _, fragment ->
    if (fragment is PayWebViewFragment) {
        fragment.webViewLoadListener = object : WebViewLoadListener {
            override fun onLoading(createResponse: PayCreateResponse) {
                //Write you logic here.
            }

            override fun onLoadFinish(createResponse: PayCreateResponse) {
                //Write you logic here.
            }

            override fun onError(
                createResponse: PayCreateResponse,
                code: Int?,
                message: String?,
            ) {
                //Write you logic here.
            }

            override fun onPaymentCanceled(createResponse: PayCreateResponse) {
                //Write you logic here.
            }

            override fun onPaymentConfirmed(createResponse: PayCreateResponse) {
                //Write you logic here.
            }
        }
    }
}
```
### Using BottomSheetDialog
![](art/art-05.jpg)

The library can be using through a `PayBottomSheetDialog` implementation. 
The`WebViewLoadListener` also works as explained above.
```kotlin
PayBottomSheetDialog(
    context = this,
    createResponse = payCreateResponse,
    title = "Dialog Title",
    subtitle = "Dialog Subtitle",
    shouldUseHeader = true,
).show()
```

### Complete the Payment
When the payment has been confirmed, the `PayCompleteResponse` object must be used to complete the payment using the Rest API. The request will return a `PayCompleteResponseWrapper` with the details and current status.
